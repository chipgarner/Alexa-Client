# Alexa-Client
Access Alexa Voice Services with python 3.6 on Windows 10. This may still work on Ubuntu but I haven't tried it.

A minor simplification and edits of https://github.com/ewenchou/alexa-client. Only does one request at a time.

Does the required authorization, sends a .wav request to AVS, gets and saves the response as a .mp3, plays the .mp3.
